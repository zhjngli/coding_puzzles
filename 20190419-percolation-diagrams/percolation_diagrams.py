# Lisa is studying patterns in an NxN grid. The patterns she's interested in are called percolation patterns. Such patterns are formed when white pixels are embedded in an NxN grid of black pixels in such a way that:
# each row of the grid has exactly one segment of white pixels, and
# the white segments of any two consecutive rows overlap in at least one column. 
 
# This diagram (see 'percolation_example.png') shows two of the 215401 percolation patterns that may be embedded in a 5x5 grid, as well as an invalid pattern. The bottom pattern is not a valid percolation pattern for either of two reasons:
#   - the white segments in rows 1 and 2 donâ€™t share a column
#   - the bottom row contains more than one white segment.
 
# Lisa knows that there are far too many patterns to list, but she's still interested in counting them. She has calculated the number of valid patterns in a 50x50 grid and found that the last nine digits of the result are 665161235. 
 
# How many valid percolation patterns can be made in a 200x200 grid? (supply only the last 9 digits of this number as your answer)
